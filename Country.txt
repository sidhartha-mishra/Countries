A country is a distinct territorial body, a state, nation, or other political entity.[1] It may be a sovereign state or part of a larger state,[2] and may be a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics.
The largest country by area is Russia, while the smallest is the microstate Vatican City. The Pitcairn Islands is the least populous, while the most populous is China.

The term "country" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. By one application of the declarative theory of statehood and constitutive theory of statehood,[8] there are 206 sovereign states; of which 193 are members of the UN, two have observer status at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UNGA.
The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. They are listed together alongside sovereign states on lists of countries, and many are treated as a separate "country of origin" in international trade[9][10] as the British Virgin Islands[11] and Hong Kong are.[12][13][14]
A few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries, such as the Danish Realm,[15] the Kingdom of the Netherlands,[note 1] France,[16] the Realm of New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[17]
