A country is a distinct territorial body, a state, nation, or other political entity.[1] It may be a sovereign state or part of a larger state,[2] and may be a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics.

The largest country by area is Russia, while the smallest is the microstate Vatican City. The Pitcairn Islands is the least populous, while the most populous is China.
